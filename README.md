# Daily-Planner

## Description

This app was designed to be a daily planner whererin appointments can be entered into the corresponding hour blocks and stored in localStorage for access even upon page reload. 

## Usage

This app functions simply, using text entry and save button functionality to store input data into localStorage. This data is then loaded into the proper location upon page load and persists through multiple reloads. 

The app is live at this URL: https://lamperouge1218.github.io/Daily-Planner/

and here is a screenshot of the final product's intial page: ![Daily Planner Screenshot](./assets/plannerscreenshot.PNG/)

## Credits

For this project, I collaborated with [Mark Lindsey](https://github.com/mrl-jr). I also used the sites [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to assist with localStorage.
